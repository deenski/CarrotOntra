## Setup

- install uv: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
- clone this repo
- `uv run main.py`


## Ground Rules

- if it's not an asset (image) it goes in main.py
  - assets should go in a directory called `assets`
  - images should go in `assets/images`, etc..
- stay away from building classes for now, if possible
- no push to main, create a branch, push to your branch, open a pull request
